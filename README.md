# Lux Desktop

> *"Vos estis **lux** mundi. Non potest civitas abscondi supra montem posita;"*

> *"You are the **light** of the world. It is impossible to hide a city on a hill;"*

Book of Matthew 5:13

Lux is an extremely smooth remote desktop client. Lux can connect to [Tenebra](https://github.com/UE2020/tenebra) to control another machine.

## Usage

Lux is a cross-platform desktop app that depends on FLTK, SDL, and GStreamer. It can be compiled using `./polybuild.sh`, which works much like `make`.
